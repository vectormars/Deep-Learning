### Data Flow Graphs
In TensorFlow, computation is described using data flow graphs.
* Each **node** of the graph represents an instance of a mathematical operation (like addition, division, or multiplication)
* Each **edge** is a multi-dimensional data set (tensor) on which the operations are performed.
  * **Normal edges**, transfer data structure (tensors) where it is possible that the output of one operation becomes the input for another operation
  * **Special edges**, which are used to control dependency between two nodes to set the order of operation where one node waits for another to finish.

##### Constants
```constant(value, dtype=None, shape=None, name='Const', verify_shape=False)```
* ```value``` is an actual constant value which will be used in further computation,
* ```dtype``` is the data type parameter (e.g., float32/64, int8/16, etc.)
* ```shape``` is optional dimensions
* ```name``` is an optional name for the tensor
* ```verify_shape``` is a boolean which indicates verification of the shape of values.      
Eg1: ```z = tf.constant(5.2, name="x", dtype=tf.float32)```    
[Eg2](Codes/Constant_Ex_1.ipynb), [Eg3](Codes/Constant_Ex_2.ipynb)    

##### Variable
```k = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]), name="k")```    
```y = tf.Variable(x + 5, name='y')```     
Another way to use variables in TensorFlow is in calculations where that variable isnâ€™t trainable and can be defined in the following way
```k = tf.Variable(tf.add(a, b), trainable=False)```   
[Eg1](Codes/Variable_Ex_1.ipynb), [Eg2](Codes/Variable_Ex_2.ipynb)

##### Sessions
A session encapsulates the control and state of the TensorFlow runtime. A session without parameters will use the default graph created in the current session, otherwise the session class accepts a graph parameter, which is used in that session to be executed.

In order to actually evaluate the nodes, we must run a computational graph within a session.

##### TensorBoard 
TensorBoard is a visualization tool for analyzing data flow graphs. This can be useful for gaining better understanding of machine learning models.
```
import tensorflow as tf


x = tf.constant(-2.0, name="x", dtype=tf.float32)
a = tf.constant(5.0, name="a", dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(13.0, name="b", dtype=tf.float32)


y = tf.Variable(tf.add(tf.multiply(a, x), b))


init = tf.global_variables_initializer()


with tf.Session() as session:
    merged = tf.summary.merge_all() // new
    writer = tf.summary.FileWriter("logs", session.graph) // new


    session.run(init)
    print session.run(y)
```
Then, ```tensorboard --logdir logs/```. Now TensorBoard is started and running on the default port 6006. 

#### Mathematics with TensorFlow
**Tensors** are the basic data structures in TensorFlow, and they represent the connecting **edges** in a dataflow graph.

A tensor simply identifies a multidimensional array or list. The tensor structure can be identified with three parameters: rank, shape, and type.

* **Rank**: Identifies the number of dimensions of the tensor. A rank is known as the order or n-dimensions of a tensor, where for example rank 1 tensor is a vector or rank 2 tensor is matrix.
* **Shape**: The shape of a tensor is the number of rows and columns it has.
* **Type**: The data type assigned to tensor elements.

To build a tensor in TensorFlow, we can build an n-dimensional array. This can be done easily by using the NumPy library, or by converting a Python n-dimensional array into a TensorFlow tensor.
