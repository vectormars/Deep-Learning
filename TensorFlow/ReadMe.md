### Data Flow Graphs
In TensorFlow, computation is described using data flow graphs.
* Each **node** of the graph represents an instance of a mathematical operation (like addition, division, or multiplication)
* Each **edge** is a multi-dimensional data set (tensor) on which the operations are performed
